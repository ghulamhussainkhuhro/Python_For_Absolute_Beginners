#Guess the output

# Integer division with float and int will give int displayed as float

a,b = 1.5,3

c = a//b # read as a integer division b
d = a/b  # read as a divided by b

print("Result of a//b is : ",c)

print("Result of a/b is : ",d)

print("Result of floor(a/b) is : " )

# Result of (a//b) is same as result of floor(a/b)

#floor() is a function, it gives the closest integer which is lesser than or equal to float value
