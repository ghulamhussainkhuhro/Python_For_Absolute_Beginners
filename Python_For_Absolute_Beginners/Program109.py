# In OOP we have learned three types of methods()
"""
1. Static methods:
These are used when we don't need to use any variable neither instance nor class attribute
are used written using @staticmethod decorator

2. Non Static or Instance method
These are used when we only need to use instance variables
they always require self argument with them

3. class method
These methods are used when we only need to use class attributes 
we can update our class attributes using class methods
